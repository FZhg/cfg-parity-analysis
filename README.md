# Observation on the [Dataflow Project of the Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/manual/checker-framework-dataflow-manual.pdf).

The developers who wants to use the Dataflow library should be careful to override their own `object.equals` and `object.hashcode` methods for the `Store`. (I had a bug because of this!)
The work-list algorithm use these to detect fixed-point.

The terminology of `Store` is misleading. In web or app development, a data store is usually a single source of data. This instance should be a singleton.
'Snapshot' could be a better name for the dataflow information at each program point.

# High Level Description of My  Implementation

There are 4 essential components to define a dataflow analysis with monotone framework:

* A lattice ($L$, $\sqsubseteq$)
* An abstraction function $\alpha$
* A transfer function $f$
* An initial dataflow analysis assumptions, $\sigma_0$

## Lattice, $L$

```mermaid
graph BT;
    Bottom-->Even;
    Bottom-->Odd;
    Even-->Top;
    Odd-->Top;
```

## Abstract Functions, $\alpha$

### Integer

$$
\alpha_{int}(n: Integer Literal)  =
\begin{cases}
Even & \text{n is Even} \\
Odd &  \text{n is Odd}   \\
\end{cases}
$$

### Integer Addition and Subtraction


|        | $\bot$ | Even   | Odd    | $\top$ |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ |
| Even   | $\bot$ | Even   | Odd    | $\top$ |
| Odd    | $\bot$ | Odd    | Even   | $\top$ |
| $\top$ | $\bot$ | $\top$ | $\top$ | $\top$ |

### Integer Multiplication


|        | $\bot$ | Even   | Odd    | $\top$ |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ | $\bot$ |
| Even   | $\bot$ | Even   | Even   | Even   |
| Odd    | $\bot$ | Even   | Odd    | $\top$ |
| $\top$ | $\bot$ | Even   | $\top$ | $\top$ |

### Integer Division

Return  $\top$ no matter the operands are.

## Transfer Function, $f$

$$
f(n: Integer Literal) = \sigma[n \mapsto \alpha_{int}(n)]
$$

$$
f(a = b: Assignment) =  \sigma[\sigma(a) \mapsto \sigma(b)]
$$

$$
f(a + b: Integer Addition) =  \sigma[\sigma(a+b) \mapsto \alpha_{Integer Addition}(\sigma(a), \sigma(b))]
$$

$$
f(a - b: Integer Subtraction) =  \sigma[\sigma(a-b) \mapsto \alpha_{Integer Subtraction}(\sigma(a), \sigma(b))]
$$

$$
f(a * b: Integer Multiplication) =  \sigma[\sigma(a-b) \mapsto \alpha_{Integer Multiplication}(\sigma(a), \sigma(b))]
$$

$$
f(a \div b: Integer Division) =  \sigma[\sigma(a \div b) \mapsto \top)]
$$


$$
f(a \% b: Integer Modulus) =  \sigma[\sigma(a \% b) \mapsto \top)]
$$

$$
f(+ a : Integer Plus) =  \sigma[\sigma(+a) \mapsto \sigma(a)]
$$

$$
f(- a : Integer Minus) =  \sigma[\sigma(-a) \mapsto \sigma(a)]
$$

Otherwise,

$$
f(Expression) =  \sigma
$$

## Initial Dataflow Information Assumptions, $\sigma_0$

For all parameters , 

$$
\sigma_0(x) = \top
$$


For all other expression (`String`, `Double`),
$$\sigma_0(exp) = \bot$$.

## Forward Analysis

Parity Analysis  is neither must or may analysis. Unlike Live Variable Analysis, which maps a program point to a set of variables, and Reaching Definitions,  which maps a program point to a set of definitions,  Parity Analysis maps a program point to a map of variables and their parity. In other words, the abstract state lattice of Parity Analysis is not a powerset.

Parity Analysis is a forward Analysis. Because It uses the dataflow information from predecessors to compute the dataflow information after the current program point.
Any change to the dataflow information, the work-list algorithm have to update the successor's dataflow information.

# AST or CFG?

If I had implemented the parity analysis on AST, then all the flow-sensitive information would be gone.

```java
public class Test(){
    public int  test(){
        int a = 1;
        int a= 2;
        return a;
    }
}
```

```mermaid
---
title: The AST of the test method
---
graph TD;
    test-->id1[=];
    test-->id2[=];
    id1[=]-->id3[a];
    id1[=]-->id4[1];
    id2[=]-->id5[a];
    id2[=]-->id6[2];
    test-->id7[return];
    id7[return]-->id8[a];
```

```mermaid
---
title: The CFG of the test method
---
graph TD;
    entry-->id1[a=1];
    id1[a=1]-->id2[a=2];
    id2[a=2]-->id3[return a];
```

Even though  source code suggest that a would be even when returned. The AST wouldn't know which assignment (`a=1` or `a=2`) is closer to the `return` statement. In conclusion, the parity analysis should be implemented on CFG.

# Refinement (Implementation TBD)

## The EqualTo & UnequalTo boolean expression

I could add the following transfer functions for equality checking.

$$ f(exp1 == exp2: Equal To)_{TrueBranch} = \sigma[\sigma(exp1) \mapsto \sigma(exp2), \sigma(exp2) \mapsto \sigma(exp1)]$$
$$ f(exp1 == exp2: Equal To)_{FalseBranch} = \sigma$$
$$ f(exp1 != exp2: Unequal To)_{TrueBranch} = \sigma$$
$$ f(exp1 != exp2: Unequal To)_{FalseBranch} = \sigma[\sigma(exp1) \mapsto \sigma(exp2), \sigma(exp2) \mapsto \sigma(exp1)]$$





For example, if  exp1 and epx2 are integer literals,  variables or addition of them, we can get their parity though transfer function defined earlier. 
If they are strings, they should be $\bot$.

## Integer Lattice + Parity Lattice
```mermaid
graph BT;
    Bottom-->id1["...-2, 0, 2..."];
    Bottom-->id2["...-3, -1, 1, 3..."];
id1["...-2, 0, 2..."] --> Even;
id2["...-3, -1, 1, 3..."]-->Odd;
Even-->Top;
Odd-->Top;
```

In this way, I can use the concrete values to first calculate the result for integer division and integer modules and then convert the result to abstract values of even or odd.

## Float, Double, Short and Long Literal

Float and Double can have parity too, when their decimal parts are zeros. 

My implementation will return $\top$ for short and long integer literals. But I could get their parity. 


# Correctness
I don't false positive and negative should apply to Parity Analysis. Since we are not testing a hypothesis. 

My implementation should be always correct. Because the dataflow information only get coarser. It only goes toward the trivial answer. Thus, it should be always correct.
